        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">About Me</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Emma and I am a senior Student-Athlete at
          Stanford University studying Computer Science with a concentration in
          Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). After graduation, Iâ€™m excited to
          pursue a masterâ€™s degree to deepen my knowledge of how technology and
          design shape our everyday interactions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          My passion lies in using technology as a tool to improve peopleâ€™s
          lives. Through my studies and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve explored
          everything from mobile app development and data visualization to user
          research and interface design. Iâ€™m excited by the endless ways tech
          can be appliedâ€”whether itâ€™s building intuitive products, exploring the
          future of social platforms, designing for behavior change, or even
          contributing to fields like education, health, or creative tools. No
          matter the direction, Iâ€™m driven by a desire to create thoughtful,
          impactful experiences that put people first.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Beyond the Classroom</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          As a Division I Student-Athlete and team captain on Stanford's Beach
          Volleyball team, Iâ€™ve learned the importance of leadership, time
          management, and resilience. Iâ€™m also an Athlete-to-Athlete mentor,
          guiding younger student-athletes on balancing academics, athletics,
          and personal growth. These experiences have sharpened my ability to
          collaborate, lead, and adapt in high-pressure environments.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In my free time, I enjoy staying active outdoors - whether it's
          playing beach volleyball, going for a hike, or picking up a new hobby
          just for fun. You can also find me curled up with a good book or
          laughing at a corny joke!

            â†’ Iâ€™ve been leading my Division I beach volleyball team as team
            captain, an experience thatâ€™s sharpened my communication,
            leadership, and decision-making skills under pressure. Balancing
            high-stakes competition with academics has taught me how to stay
            focused, adaptable, and team-oriented.
